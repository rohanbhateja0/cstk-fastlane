# AI Prompts & Templates

FastLane includes powerful AI prompts for accelerating development workflows. These prompts are designed to generate high-quality, FastLane-compatible code that follows all architectural patterns and best practices.

## 🧠 **Why FastLane AI Works: Context is King**

FastLane AI prompts succeed where generic code generation fails because **context is everything**. Our prompts provide comprehensive context that enables AI to generate production-ready code:

### **Rich Context Sources**
- **📚 Comprehensive Documentation**: Complete field definitions, rendering parameters, business logic patterns, and implementation examples
- **🎨 Figma Design Integration**: Direct access to designs with exact node IDs, semantic variables, and design system patterns  
- **🔧 Proven Code Patterns**: Real working examples with Sitecore Content SDK integration and ShadCN UI composition
- **⚠️ Anti-Pattern Knowledge**: Built-in awareness of common pitfalls and how to avoid them (width issues, TypeScript errors, etc.)
- **🎯 Preservation Requirements**: Clear boundaries between what must be preserved vs what can be customized
- **🧪 Testing Patterns**: Comprehensive test examples that validate both functionality and integration

### **Context-Driven Results**
- ✅ **Functional Components**: AI generates components that work immediately in Sitecore Page Editor
- ✅ **Correct Patterns**: Follows FastLane conventions for buttons, layouts, accessibility, and responsive design
- ✅ **Zero Boilerplate**: No generic code - everything is specific to FastLane architecture and customer needs
- ✅ **Preservation Guarantee**: Sitecore functionality preserved through explicit context about what not to change
